- I highly advised you to checkout BST before this
- AVL a.k.a balanced BST
    - It is much the same as BST but it also has "depth" property because we need this depth to check if
    the tree is balanced. 



balanced is when the different is 0 or 1

- Version 1 insert then check if balance
- Version 2 balance-ish insert


ô mạnh là khi insert thì nó insert theo kiểu balance luôn
trong lab có bài là insert bth trc sau đó ktr xem nó có balance hay ko
