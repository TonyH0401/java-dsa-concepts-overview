    - Use this for a more visual appoarch: https://visualgo.net/en/bst.

- Types of BST, this is my overview:
    - BST 
    - Left Skewed/Right Skewed
    - AVL the differences between branches is 0 or 1 (later)

- BST Depth and Height explained:
    - https://mdkulkarni76.medium.com/height-and-depth-of-a-binary-tree-2a9f115eeee9
    - The layer/height starts at 0 but the depth counts at 1

- Post order:
    - Left -> Right -> Root
