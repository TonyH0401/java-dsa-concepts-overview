- You need to study BST -> AVL

- Heap is a tree like datatype, more like an AVL tree but they are different,
instead of right being larger and left being smaller, the heap has max heap
and min heap, with max heap the tree is always bigger than the root and
for the min heap the tree is always smaller than the root but they are
balanced tree.

- There is also a heap sort (maybe I will cover this in the future)

- There is also priority queue (maybe I will cover this in the future)
